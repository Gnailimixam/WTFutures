# WTFutures Engine

Inspired by [soulwire](https://github.com/soulwire)'s [mad-libs style random sentence generator](https://github.com/soulwire/WTFEngine), and remixed to be appropriate for all audiences who are interested in thinking about the future.

It's very simple to use and now allows you to populate it using either vanilla JavaScript objects, JSON files or direct feeds from Google spreadsheets.
